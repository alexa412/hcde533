                    <h2> About Me </h2>
                        <p> My name is Alexa Schlein! I'm an HCDE Master's student. I'm taking this class because I'm a former biomedical engineer, but it's been years since I've 3D printed anything or used a laser cutter. So, I'm excited to get refreshed on all things digital fabrication, relearn best DFM practices, and make something cool! So much of my previous experiences making things was for engineering purposes, where functionality > design. I'm looking forward to designing things that look cool AND work great.
                        </p>
                    <h3> My skills </h3>
                        <p> It's been a while, but I *think* I can help out my classmates with drawing things in CAD, designing things to be 3D printed, and designing things to be CNC'd.
                        </p>
