                    <h2>Prototyping, Part 1</h2>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>I designed a simple, 4-sided box in Rhino. The slots are 0.25 in and the opening is about 0.27 in. I drew a stars/swirly design in Adobe Illustrator, and then imported that to Rhino for engraving. But, I never got to engraving... more on that later!</p>
                            <img src="/hcde533/images/Engraving.png" alt="design in Rhino with stars engraving" width="400">
                        <h3>Initial Test Cut</h3>
                            <p>I first decided to do a test cut without the engraving, just to make sure I had designed my slots correctly. So, I exported the cuts only to a DXF, then into KiCAD, then into Bantam. I ended up having to do several test cuts, but my settings in Bantam were generally around:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1/32" Flat End Mill</li>
                                    <li>Traces ON (which was a mistake)</li>
                                    <li>X: 70mm</li>
                                    <li>Y: 100mm</li>
                                    <li>Z: 1.5mm</li>
                                    <li>Z Offset: ~1.6mm (depending on the sacrificial layer used)</li>
                                    <li>Planned Offset: 5mm in X, 5mm in Y</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>With traces turned ON, my model appeared like this in Bantam, which I thought was normal:</p>

                        <h3>Milling - Tape Failure</h3>
                            <p>Tape Failure! I had to run 4 test mill jobs, during which I had to stop the job each time because the material detached from the sacrificial layer. I guess I'm bad at applying double sided tape!</p>
                        <h3>Milling - Trace Failure:</h3>
                            <p>Once I finally got the milling to work, and I got to see a completed job and parts... Well, no surprise here, they had tracing AND cuts instead of cuts only. Junchao swooped in to help me and explained that I had traces turned on. However, after turning traces off, Junchao pointed out my dog bones were too small and were missing on the left side of my part:</p>

                    <h2>Prototyping, Part 2</h2>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>I went back into Rhino and added the larger dog bones, and repeated the Rhino, KiCAD, Bantam workflow. This time around, I turned traces OFF. I did have another issue with Bantam adding traces when I didn't need them, and I had to return to Rhino to make sure all of my curves were closed. After fixing that, milling worked.</p>
                        <h3>Milling Success</h3>
                            <p>After fixing everything in Rhino and Bantam, my parts were milled successfully!</p>

                        <h3>Design Failure</h3>
                            <p>However, I made a mistake in my design! My parts didn't fit together, even with attempting to sand. At first, I thought it was because I made the slots too small.</p>
                            <img src="/hcde533/images/FailedAssembly.jpeg" alt="milled parts that don't fit" width="300">
                            <p>It turns out, I had an alignment issue with the slots in my design. See the black line in the image below. Note to self: Always check your design before machining it!</p>

                    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
                            <h3>Design</h3>
                                <p>I redesigned my part one more time in Rhino! This time around, the part is designed correctly. The part that fits into the slots is 0.25 in, and the slots themselves are about 1.05x that length.</p>

                            <h3>Bantam Settings</h3>
                            <p>After repeating the Rhino, KiCAD, Bantam workflow steps, for my final mill job, my settings were:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1/32" Flat End Mill</li>
                                    <li>Traces OFF</li>
                                    <li>X: 70.3mm</li>
                                    <li>Y: 101.6mm</li>
                                    <li>Z: 1.56mm</li>
                                    <li>Z Offset: 1.6mm</li>
                                    <li>Planned Offset: 5mm in X, 5mm in Y</li>

                    <h2> Reflection </h2>
                        <p> I was rushing on this homework, which was a big mistake. I should really slow down to verify my parts are designed correctly before attempting to machine them. That'll save me a lot of time and money. </p>
