                    <h2>Week 1 - Mold Design</h2>
                        <h3>Rhino Model</h3>
                            <p>I made a simple, balloon-like mold-for-molds model in Rhino using revolve, boolean union, and boolean split commands. I also used spheres for keys. This was the easy part for me!</p>

                        <h3>3D Printing My Mold for Molds</h3>
                            <p>I actually stopped my first print mid-print to add a vent hole, which was a mistake. Anyway, I printed both sides during the same print using Noelle's slicing settings that she sent in Discord. It took about six hours to print.</p>

                        <h3>Silicone Mixing & Pouring</h3>
                            <p>I bought small, disposable measuring cups at TAP Plastics for mixing. But, I didn't have cups large enough for one side of my mold. So, I used a clean Venti Starbucks cup and poured about 80mL of part A and part B of the Ooommoo silicone into the Starbucks cup and mixed them together with a plastic utensil. Lesson learned about being prepared with proper materials. I poured almost the entire amount into one size of the mold (160 mL of the mixture), and repeated this process for the second side of the mold.</p>
                        <h3>Final Mold</h3>
                            <p>I let my mold cure for over 10 hours because I was out of my home. It was a bit difficult to get out of the 3D printed mold-for-molds, but I was able to do so by prying it out with a cheese knife.</p>
                            <img src="/hcde533/images/mold.png" alt="oommoo silicone mold" width="400">
                            <p>There are a few issues with my Oommoo mold. (1) The two flat surfaces don't mate perfectly. That could be a result of the flat part of my mold-for-molds not printing well. (2) The part of the sprue that enters the cavity is too narrow. (3) The vent hole is unnecessary, and the plaster will come out through there.</p>
                            <img src="/hcde533/images/MoldIssues.png" alt="oommoo silicone mold with mating issues" width="350">
                            <p>I didn't have time this week to do multiple iterations to solve these issues. Junchao told me I can tape my mold together and still use it, so I may try that anyway before making a new mold-for-molds and silicone mold this week.</p>
                        <h3>To Do</h3>
                        <p>So, I do want to test my current mold to see if I can avoid remaking it, but I have a few things to do:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cut a entrance hole where the sprue meets the largest cylinder shape</li>
                                <li>Tape or fill in the unnecessary vent hole</li>
                                <li>Tape my mold closed and test it with plaster</li>
                                <li>If I'm redesigning the mold-for-molds, fix the sprue, vent, and 3D printer settings</li>
                                <li>Cast 4 plaster objects</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h2>Week 2 - Casting</h2>
                        <h3>Pre-Cast</h3>
                            <p>During class last Tuesday, I learned that my mold is still usable. Nadya and Noelle suggested that I use rubber bands on top of cardboard to squish the two oommoo mold halves together, and Junchao said I can block the unneeded vent hole with something and make the sprue bigger. So, I set out for my local Michael's store and purchased a plastic measuring cup for the plaster because the small paper cups I had bought previously at TAP Plastics were too small for this project. I also bought x-acto blades to cut the mold.</p>
                            <p>I measured cardboard using the mold and cut it out using a box cutter. I then used the x-acto knife to cut a bit of the silicone away from the sprue to make the sprue a bit larger. Then, I secure the two halves of the mold together using the cardboard, tape, and rubber bands. The duct tape didn't actually stick very well to the mold, so I used more rubber bands in an attempt to block the vent hole.</p>
                            <img src="/hcde533/images/NewMold.png" alt="silicone mold for casting" width="400">
                        <h3>Mixing the Plaster</h3>
                            <p>I don't have a scale, so I just dumped a couple of spoonfuls of hydrostone into the plastic measuring cup and added a bit of water at a time until the mixture reached the right consistency. I tried to use a plastic spoon to pour the plaster mixture into the mold, and it would not go in. I literally said out loud, "I can't do this," then I opened up my mold, and started hacking away at the sprue in bits. I ended up with tiny bits of silicone all over my counter, but I was able to make a larger sprue without seriously damaging the mold.</p>

                        <h3>First Cast</h3>
                            <p>After that, I was finally able to get the plaster in, one spoonful at a time. I would hit the mold against my counter to allow the plaster to settle and to get any air holes out. I threw away the remainder of the wet plaster. I waited a few hours while I was doing other things for my plaster to set. I noticed almost immediately that the plaster was heating up. When I opened my mold, I was able to get my cast part out easily!</p>

                        <h3>More Casting</h3>
                            <p>I used the plaster cylinder that was cast in the vent hole to block material from entering that hole for the next three casts. Again, I just mixed a random amount of plaster with water until it was the right consistency. For each cast, I let the material set for a couple of hours while I did other things. Afterwards, I cut/broke away the portion that was cast in the sprue channel.</p>
                        <h3>Final Parts</h3>
                            <p>I was able to create four identical balloon-ish parts! You can see how the layers of my 3D printed mold-for-molds showed up in my silicone mold and then in the cast parts. </p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>If I could do this over again, I would make sure my mold-for-molds doesn;t have a vent. I also would lower the layer height of my 3D print to avoid the texture. I would also like to make a more complicated part out of resin or perhaps chocolate!</p>
