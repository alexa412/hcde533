                <h2> Process </h2>
                <p> Like most people in our class, I'm not really used to parametric modeling - certainly not in Grasshopper. So, I decided to create a flower-like shape in Grasshopper that I thought would assemble well.
                </p>
                <h3> Grasshopper Parametric Model </h3>
                <p> I created my shape in Grasshopper with a polar array of circles and a polar array of rectangles (~0.4 in depth). Step 1: I used the polar array of circles, a pentagon component, and a trim with regions component to make the general floral shape.

                        <br>
                    Step 2: Then, I used a polar array of rectangles and and a vtrim with regions component to make the slots.

                        <br>
                    Step 3: Then, I joined the curves and used an extrude component to extrude the shape.

                </p>
                <p> The cardboard thickness is set by a number slider component. Using a subtract component, I subtract the cardboard thickness by 0.020 in for the slot width for a press fit. So, if you change the cardboard thickness, the slot width will adjust as well. See my definitions below!

                <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                <h3> Prototyping </h3>
                    <p> To figure out the right dimensions for the extrusion, I took several measurements and found the average of the cardboard thickness: 0.125 +/- 0.009 in. I set the cardboard thickness in Grasshopper, and then baked the into Grasshopper. Then, I exported the shape into an Adobe Illustrator file.</p>
                <h3> Laser Cutting </h3>
                    <p> I first ran a test cut, cutting 2 components, to make sure the dimensions and press fit were appropriate. I cut out my components using the laser cutter in the 8. I used the settings for mat board, but I set the material thickness to 0.45 in for cutting. My parts didn't catch on fire! I had to cut on 2 pieces of cardboard because my cardboard pieces were taken from a smaller Amazon box. </p>
                    
                    <p> Here is a GIF of my parts mid-cut! </p>

                    <h2> Final Kit </h2>
                    <p> My final kit consists of 40 pieces (several spares). Here's a cardboard crown made with 14 pieces!

                    And a fun structure made with 17 pieces (+ the crown)!

                    It passes the shake test!

                    <h2> Reflection </h2>
                    <p> I didn't need to make my slots as long as I did. Also, I didn't include a chamfer or fillet on my edges because I couldn't figure out how to do it in Grasshopper. The insertion was a bit difficult and a fillet would've helped. Maybe next time! I wanted to know if I could use a number slider to change the number of circles for the polar array component as well, but I ran into trouble with the polygon component that's used for trimming. </p>

                    <p> I used Junchao's tutorial and Nadya's in-class demonstration to complete this assignment. There were no techs at the 8, so shout out to Ji Su for helping me with the settings on the laser cutter!
