                <h2> Process </h2>
                <p> Luckily, I'm not a novice when it comes to using a laser cutter. Actually, I'm guilty of hogging a laser cutter when I was in undergrad for several hours to rasterize guitar sheet music into wood for a present. But, anyway, this was my first time using Rhino to design parts to be laser cut from cardboard. I initially wanted to make something really cool, like a geodesic dome kit <a href="https://malvenko.medium.com/uw-hcde598-digital-fabrication-assignment-1-laser-cut-press-fit-construction-kit-9fcaa6f7d5aa">(example)</a>. But, I wasn't able to spend time on campus this week to do some rapid prototyping iterations, so I went with a simpler design of three components: a square, a heart, and a hexagon. I just picked these shapes randomly. Well, I thought a heart was interesting. But, they can be stuck together to form abstract shapes.
                </p>
                <h3> Rhino Model </h3>
                <p> I made 2D drawings for each shape. Each component fits within a 1.5x1.5 in square. To make the square more interesting, I cut away the corners using arcs. I drew the heart using three circles and tangent lines. I drew the hexagon using line segments. I added chamfers on the slots to aid in insertion. Some images of my drawings: </p>

                <br>
                <p> To figure out the right dimensions for the extrusion, I took several measurements and found the average of the cardboard thickness: 0.148 +/- 0.012 in. I used the Join and ExtrudeCrv commands to create the 3D extruded components, 0.148 in in thickness. See my models below!

                <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                <h3> Slot Testing </h3>
                    <p> To determine the correct slot size for a press fit, I created test slots in my cardboard in the following sizes: 0.118, 0.122, 0.128, 0.132, 0.138, 0.142, and 0.145 in. Originally, I was going to test slots from 0.145-0.150 in, but after seeing some of my classmate's work, I realized that the size range would not work for a press fit. Luckily, the sizes I tested did. The best sized slot for my cardboard for a press fit is 0.122 in. So, I'll went back to Rhino and added 0.22x0.122 in slots to each of my three components. I forgot to take a picture of the test itself, but below is a picture of the slots on my cardboard. </p>

                <h3> Laser Cutting </h3>
                    <p> I exported my drawing from Rhino to an Adobe Illustrator (AI) file. I cut out my components using the small Epilog M2 [32] laser cutter in The Mill using the following settings: 50 power, 20 speed, 50 frequency. It was actually an interesting process. I used a pretty crappy and flimsy piece of cardboard, which I took from a beat up moving box. So, I had to run three cuts, cutting only a portion of the 30 components at a time, so that way I didn't accidentally cut into the damaged parts of my cardboard. Running a test cut (with the laser without cutting) was really helpful in gauging my cut accurarcy. Below is a screenshot from one of my AI files; the components are arranged in this way because a big portion of the cardboard was damaged. </p>

                    <h2> Final Kit </h2>
                    <p> My final kit consists of 39 pieces (10 + 3 spares of each component). It passes the shake test! </p>

                    <h2> Reflection </h2>
                    <p> If I learned anything from this project, it's that some cardboard is too crappy to be used to make a kit, haha. But on a more serious note, I did end up wishing that I had tested my 3D components in Rhino before cutting them. Although everything worked out fine, I do think the heart doesn't build as well with the square and the hexagon. Also, my chamfer size (0.015 in) was far too small to be useful. That dimension for a chamfer is honestly probably a relic from my time working as an engineer on small medical device components. Next time I'll increase the chamfer! </p>
