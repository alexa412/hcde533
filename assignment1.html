            <h1>Assignment 1: Laser Cut Press Fit Construction Kit!</h1>

            <h2> Finished Kit </h2>
            <p> I'm still in progress of cutting my kit, so finished kit pic TBD! For now, here is a picture of the 3D model.

            <h2> Process </h2>
            <p> Luckily, I'm not a novice when it comes to using a laser cutter. Actually, I'm guilty of hogging a laser cutter when I was in undergrad for several hours to rasterize guitar sheet music into wood for a present. But, anyway, this was my first time using Rhino to design parts to be laser cut from cardboard. I initially wanted to make something really cool, like a geodesic dome kit <a href="https://malvenko.medium.com/uw-hcde598-digital-fabrication-assignment-1-laser-cut-press-fit-construction-kit-9fcaa6f7d5aa">(example)</a>. But, I wasn't able to spend time on campus this week to do some rapid prototyping iterations, so I went with a simpler design of three components: a square, a heart, and a hexagon. I just picked these shapes randomly. Well, I thought a heart was interesting. But, they can be stuck together to form abstract shapes.
            </p>
            <h3> Rhino Model </h3>
            <p> I made 2D drawings for each shape. Each component fits within a 1.5x1.5 in square. To make the square more interesting, I cut away the corners using arcs. I drew the heart using three circles and tangent lines. I drew the hexagon using line segments. I added chamfers on the slots to aid in insertion. Some images of my drawings:

            <img src="component-dwgs.png" alt="square, hexagon, and heart drawings in Rhino" width="1700" height="598">
            </p>
            <p> To figure out the right dimensions for the extrusion, I took several measurements and found the average of the cardboard thickness: 0.148 +/- 0.012 in. I used the Join and ExtrudeCrv commands to create the 3D extruded components, 0.148 in in thickness. See my models below!

            </p>
            <h3> Cut Outs - TBD </h3>
            <p> I'm going to do a slot size test to determine the right size for the press fit, by creating test slots that differed by a thou, ranging from 0.145 in to 0.150 in. The best sized slot for my cardboard for a press fit is X in. [insert pic of slot test]. So, I went back to Rhino and added the right sized slots to my components: 0.22xX in.
            </p>
            <h3> Preparing for Cutting - TBD </h3>
            <p>I exported my drawing from Rhino to an AI file. I copied each shape in Adobe Illustrator so that I had 10 of each, and arranged them for cutting.
            </p>
            <h3> Laser Cutting </h3>
            <p> Using the Epilog M2 [32/40] laser cutter in The Mill, I cut out my components using the following settings: X power, Y speed, and Z frequency. Notes on cutting to be inserted when completed.
